## Background
Hello! My name is John Warner. I come from an RF engineering background, working for corporate contractors with the US Department of Defense. There, I cultivated a skill set in critical analysis, technical writing, and customer communication, as well as in physics and mathematics which are quite ubiquitous.

I've always had a passion for games of all kinds. Aside from being a fun way to spend time with friends and loved ones, I think games also offer unique opportunities for an individual to drop all "real" concerns, to engage with something rather frivolous, and, despite this, to still develop valuable new perspectives applicable to real life. From this, surprisingly powerful opportunities for growth arise.

Boundaries and limitations, such as those set by rules and game mechanics, form a real world that a real subjective “self” must navigate, and thus, games require both immersive engagement and focused, detailed scrutiny. In this way, games pave the psychological pathway towards increased efficacy with problem solving, by decompressing the "need" to solve the problems, and by allowing for a personal detachment from them. All of that is to say games are not only fun, but they're fruitful in ways that "real" life situations can never be. To me, they have been therapeutic and empowering. If other people are like me, then games are an indispensable asset in shaping both society and ourselves.

I grew up with a computer in my room, and my fascination with video games grew as I encountered various modding communities. As a teenager I used the internet to teach myself some fundamentals to video game development, which was one of the most fun and empowering time periods of my life. I learned a great deal about the process of creating logic, levels, and art assets. My love for programming and game design had been sparked!

When I was preparing to go to college I could not ignore my passions for both problem solving and computers. After investigating several engineering disciplines I chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. After I graduated from college, I started off my professional career in the field of RF engineering. My computer engineering background enabled me to go above and beyond my job description, by developing software tools to increase efficiency and automate work-flow. I notably gained some attention for taking the lead on experimental measurements, developing automated radio systems, and report generation, as well as for appropriately handling interactions with people outside of the company, and outstanding communication with technical writers. I received multiple bonuses and was even named Employee of the Quarter at one point.

Although I encountered success in the RF field and found it to be both challenging and rewarding, my mind swam with thoughts of games and the power they have over us. I dreamt of creating engaging video games that help shape the world for the better. Games that encourage critical thinking and drive communication skills. Games that enable people and build confidence. 

Recently, I set forth to accomplish this dream and began teaching myself the necessary tools to enter the game development industry. I have been learning the Unreal and Unity development engines through various online resources, including official documentation, project tutorials, and coursework. I created multiple prototypes in Unity (see [here](../)) in order to code various mechanics found commonly in video games . With my well-established base in computer engineering, my professionally tested abilities for communication and math, and my recently refined skill set in game programming and development, I believe that I am ready to begin working on my skills in a professional setting. I would love to work together to create empowering experiences for gamers around the world!


## Personal Interests
Away from my desk, you'll find me in a variety of places. From golf courses and tennis courts to skating on my local trails or walking my dog. Of course I can't stay away from games and excellent narrative. You'll also find me at the game table surrounded by loved ones and occasionally off on my own playing guitar or assembling and painting a miniature model from the Warhammer 40k universe.
